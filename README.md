Due to the technological issue things are more challenging day by day. The more you know, the more you learn. From this findings this project is made by. Basically school’s all details written by a paper mode. There is not much use to keep all details like computerize. For all data save this can be a good software or program whatever we say, this is very helpful.There can be add some features like Teacher & Staffs Absent days and Holidays details. There are many functions can be updated and I will keep in touch with this project and keep updating new features.In this project things is like mixed with the different question from different genre. But for the knowledge of every side a student or a person should have practiced all sectors means different types of subject. From the thinking of this, in future this project will come with some extra-ordinary features like, user part, because this time user can’t do anything. Next time user can be capable of show their details and other feature. And also come with more update version.<br/>

#History<br/>
<small>In this 21th century, we are living in information era, amassing data is facile and storing it less expensive. Day by day information is increasing in all sectors, but ability to understand and make use of that information does not growth. The school billing system project in c keeps record all the students, teachers and staffs working in the institution. The program is run by the administrator who can add, record, modify, if unnecessary then delete record and also find records according to the need. This basic feature of this project is that it shows fees that the students need to pay or dues and advance of the students. It also records the information related to salary that is to be provided to teachers and staffs working in the organizations.</small>
